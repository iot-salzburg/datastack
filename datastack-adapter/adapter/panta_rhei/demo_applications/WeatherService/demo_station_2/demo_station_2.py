Demo Setting: Connected Cars
    car1:   The connected car wants to enhance it's safety by retrieving temperature data, to warn the driver on
            approaching slippery road sections. As each car has also temperature data that is of interest for other
            cars, it sends this data to the the platform.
    car2:   The connected car wants to enhance it's safety by retrieving temperature data, to warn the driver on
            approaching slippery road sections. As each car has also temperature data that is of interest for other
            cars, it sends this data to the the platform.
    station1: The weather station is conducted by a local weather service provider which provides the data as a service.
    station2: The weather station is conducted by a local weather service provider which provides the data as a service.
    service_provider: The weather information provider offers temperature data for it's customers.
